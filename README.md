# Image-Classification-using-Random-Forest

When it comes to image classification, CNN(Convolution Neural Network) model is widely used in the industry. My goal here is to do image classification using any simple machine learning algorithm and achieve an accuracy closer to or even beat the accuracy of the CNN model. In the code you will see how a new feature was developed based on the similarities in the pixel intensities and how it boosted model's accuracy.
